# RosterMate - Hospital Roster Scheduling Application

## Project Overview

RosterMate is a mobile-optimized web application developed as a group project by members [Thejan](https://github.com/thejanb), [Sithum](https://github.com/SVGamage), and Ishan in October 2023. It is designed to assist hospitals in creating and managing schedules for healthcare professionals.


The application uses a combination of React for the frontend, Django for the backend, and MongoDB for the database. Firebase is used to host the frontend, while the backend is deployed on Heroku. MongoDB provides the database storage.

## Features

- Define and manage scheduling constraints.
- Create and assign different shift types (e.g., day shifts, night shifts, weekends).
- Collect staff information, including roles, skills, availability, and preferences.
- Automatically generate optimized schedules based on constraints and employee preferences.
- User-friendly interface for administrators to input data, view schedules, and make adjustments.
- Detailed testing and validation to ensure accuracy and reliability.
- Deployment on Firebase for the frontend, Heroku for the backend, and MongoDB for data storage.
